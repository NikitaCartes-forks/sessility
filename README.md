# Sessility

Sessility keeps track of sessile creatures, more often known as "AFK players".

By default, any player idling for more than 120 seconds is considered sessile. Sessile players are given a distinct color in the player tab overlay to distinguish them from other players. The sessile idle time and tab display color are both configurable.

You can also configure custom messages when a player changes their sessility. These messages are disabled by default and will only display if a configured message is present.

## Configuration

```properties
# The idle time in seconds before a player is considered sessile.
# Default: 120
sessile-timeout=120

# The message to broadcast when a player becomes sessile.
# Default: (empty)
message-sessile=%s became a sessile creature

# The color of the sessile display name. This can either be a color name or a six-digit hex code.
# Default: gray
sessile-display-color=\#aaaaaa

# The message to broadcast when a player becomes motile (the opposite of sessile).
# Default: (empty)
message-motile=%s returned from the depths
```

Sessility's configuration file does not properly handle UTF-8 characters because of the bug [MC-2215](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-2215). You can install the [MC-2215 bugfix mod](https://github.com/bytzo/mc-2215) for proper UTF-8 support.
